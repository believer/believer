# Hej! :wave:

`// That's "Hi" in Swedish` ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I'm a developer who currently works at Sweden's largest property portal, [Hemnet](http://hemnet.se/). I mostly do frontend work, but I'm always willing to learn new languages because I always get new insights while doing so (and it's just fun in general). I currently love working in [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), some recent example of work in the langauges:

#### Advent of Code

Advent of Code is year puzzle challenge spanning from December 1 to December 25.

#### Supreme

[opendevtools/supreme-rs](https://github.com/opendevtools/supreme-rs) (Rust)

#### Movies

This is a personal project where I track the movies I see.

Let me know if you find something fun in my repos!
